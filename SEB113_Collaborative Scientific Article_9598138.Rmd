## 1. \textcolor{blue}{Aim}
<!-- 0.5 pp -->
<!-- Criterion: Question, need and context -->
<!-- 7: Clear and compelling statement of the question, that is very strongly connected to the need and the context. -->
### Question
<!-- What is the scientific question being addressed? (1-2 sentences) Provide a concise statement of it. -->
<!-- Note: Why do we care about this analysis? Motivate the study. -->
<!-- Note: What is the question we're answering with our analysis? -->
PM~2.5~ is particulate matter with an equivalent aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less, and generally describe as fine particles. Fine particle like PM~2.5~ can be drawn deep into lungs, bypassing nose and mouth. Because of this, continuously over exposed it can cause bad effects and diseases to human health such as aggravation of asthma or other respiratory system damages. Elderly and children are among those who face higher risk. However, PM~2.5 are very light and tiny, that make it very easy to disturb by wind or carry within wind current.

This study is to investigate what influence do meteorological measurements such as wind speed and wind direction have on the quality of air, particularly concentrations of PM~2.5~?

As with other meteorological conditions, the explanatory variables, wind speed and wind direction are believe to have play an important role on direct or indirect correlation with the dispersion of air pollutant (e.g. PM~2.5~) concentration in the air ([@Dawson2007], [@Elminir2005225]) (Dawson et al., 2007; Elminir, 2005). 

For instance, if there is a forest fire happening at the south west of our current location, a gust of south western wind with the right speed will certainly bring the pollutant, therefore increase the pollutant concentration in the air. Vice versa, wind from other direction with certain speed could also carry away and disperse pollutants in the air.

There is no specified functional form from a scientific law to describe the influence of wind speed and wind direction affect the concentration of PM~2.5~ in the air, so linear terms is used in this model.


### The quatitative model
<!-- Specify how each element of the scientific conceptual model is to be quantified, whether it is a variable or fixed in the experiment. Express the model in words and in an equation. Use the model as a basis for selecting the measurements and the experimental design. Provide a clear statement of the quantitative methods to be used. -->
<!-- Note: what is the functional form of the regression model(s) being investigated? (at this point there should be no parameter values reported, because we haven't even seen the data yet!) -->

<!-- equation with numbering -->
\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
  \begin{aligned}
    \log PM_{2.5i} &= \sum_{j=1}^{J} \beta_{j} \cdot I\left(WD_{i} = j\right) + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \gamma_{k} \cdot WS_{i} \cdot I\left(WD_{i} = k\right) + \epsilon_{i}\\
    \epsilon_{i} &\sim N(0,\sigma^{2})
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


Variables & symbols on equation (\ref{eq:1}):

- log PM~2.5i~: *i*th observation of log PM~2.5~ (logarithm transformed)
- $WS_{i}$: Wind speed value for observation *i*
- $WD_{i}$: Wind direction value for observation *i*
- $\beta_{j}$: Partial effect of wind direction (WD~i~) on log PM~2.5~ 
- $\gamma_{k}$: Partial effect of interaction term of wind direction (WD~i~) and wind speed (WS~i~) on log PM~2.5~ 
- $J$ & $K$: Total number of wind direction, 8 (e.g. N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
- $I\left(\cdot\right)$: an indicator variable that tell us whether or not the statement inside (that Wind Direction has a particular value) is true.


**Formulate a hypothesis:**
$$
\begin{aligned}
H_0 : \beta_j, \gamma_k &= 0\\
H_1 : \beta_j, \gamma_k &\neq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

```{r 'dataprep', echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}

**Experimental design and standards**

1. **Wind:** The wind speed, $X_1$ and wind direction, $X_2$ are measured by ultrasonic sensor with 10 metres above ground level, compliant to Meteorological monitoring for ambient air quality monitoring applications (AS/NZS 3580.14:2011). Wind direction sensor is aligned to magnetic north and the output value of reported wind direction is referenced to true north by application of a magnetic declination correction of +10 degrees.
  + **Measurement units:** 
    + Wind speed, metres per second ($ms^-1$),
    + Wind direction, $degTN$

2. **PM~2.5~:** Particles as PM~2.5~ means particulate matter with an equivalent aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less. The suspended particular matter - PM~2.5~ concentrations are measured by Dichotomous Tapered Element Oscillating Balance (TEOM) Model 1405-DF fitted with Filter Dynamics Measurement System (FDMS) operated in accordance with Method 9.13, Australian Standards Methods for Pollutant Monitoring (AS/NZS 3580.9.13).
The FDMS system compensates for the loss of semi-volatile components from the collected particulate matter. Reported concentrations are uncorrected instrument output values and calculated from running 1-hour average concentrations updated at six minute intervals. Negative hourly PM~2.5~ concentrations down to -5$\mu g/m^3$  resulting from instrument noise at low particle concentrations are reported.
  + **Measurement units:** micrograms per cubic metre ($\mu g/m^3$)

There is no specified functional form from a scientific law to describe the influence of wind speed and wind direction affect the concentration of PM~2.5~ in the air, so linear terms is used in this model.

## 4. \textcolor{blue}{Analysis}
<!-- ~3 pp -->
<!-- Criterion: Quantitative methods for data analysis -->
<!-- 7: Highly skilful, appropriate application of quantitative methods. -->
### Exploratory data analysis
<!-- Numerical and graphical summary of data prior to quantitative analysis. Include histograms of key variables (1-2 pp). -->
<!-- Note: What does the data look like? Numerical summaries. Graphical summaries. -->


```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
summary(air.quality.clinton[,c(6,8,9)])
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(summary(air.quality.clinton[,c(6,8,9)]), caption="Numerical summaries of explanatory variables and outcome variable")
```


Note that raw PM~2.5~ data is logarithm transformed to get rid of some negative readings and correcting overall skew results.
```{r 'pm_histograms', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Histogram showing the variation in outcome variable, both PM2.5 and log PM2.5 '}
grid.arrange(pm1, pm2, ncol=2)
```


How many observations fall on each wind category? What the most common wind direction are?
```{r 'exploratory1', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Graph showing the variation in one explanatory variable, Wind Direction'}
wind_direction.pie
```
Figure 4 shows that most commonly wind came from East and South Eastern, on the other hand, there are very less wind come from West direction. Wind blowing from different direction can cause dispersal of air pollutants or carry within pollutants from emission source.


```{r 'exploratory2', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Histogram showing the variation in another explanatory variable, Wind Speed'}
ws.histogram
```
Figure 5 shows that the wind speed distribution in the observation data. The most common wind speed is around 2 meter per seconds, light winds.

```{r 'exploratories', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Bar plot showing the correlation of both explanatory variable, Wind Direction and Wind Speed.'}
ws_wd.plot
```
In figure 6, clearly the median show that wind from Eastern and North Eastern blow stronger compared to others.


```{r 'cor1', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='blank'}
pm_wd.plot
```
The median PM~2.5~ from North is higher than the others which might indicate that there is more air polution when the wind is blowing from the north than the other directions.


```{r 'cor2', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='blank'}
pm_ws.plot
```
Figure 8 shows that plotting single variable, wind speed alone has very low correlation with PM2.5 data, which then suggest there are others factors in the system might explain more the variability, for example the wind direction.


```{r 'cor3', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='blank'}
pm_ws_wd.plot
```
Figure 9 showing how PM~2.5~ varies with both of Wind Speed and 8 differnt Wind Directions. Wind from South and South West seem to have negative correlation with PM~2.5.


### Quantitative analysis 
<!-- A large component of the report that, similar to the Problem-Solving tasks, provides working behind the Quantitative Methods. It is crucial that output (graphical or otherwise) from R is included then cited in text (2-4pp).  -->

<!-- Note: What are the results from fitting the model(s)? -->

Fit 6 models as below:

* Model 1, log.pm2.5 ~ ws
* Model 2, log.pm2.5 ~ wd.label
* Model 3, log.pm2.5 ~ ws+wd.label
* Model 4, log.pm2.5 ~ ws:wd.label
* Model 5, log.pm2.5 ~ wd.label + ws:wd.label
* Model 6, log.pm2.5 ~ ws + wd.label + ws:wd.label

6 models to be fit to explore effect from different paramenters and any extra variability is explaining by adding extra terms or extra parameters.

Model 1  
The first model is log PM~2.5~ only predicted by Wind Speed (ws).
```{r 'model1'}
lm.pm_ws <- lm(data=air.quality.clinton, log.pm2.5 ~ ws)
```
  
Model 2  
The second model is log PM~2.5~ only predicted by Wind Direction (wd.label).
```{r 'model2'}
lm.pm_wd <- lm(data=air.quality.clinton, log.pm2.5 ~ wd.label - 1)
# Below is same model without setting the intercept to 0. For R2 and ANOVA
lm.pm_wd.intercept <- lm(data=air.quality.clinton, log.pm2.5 ~ wd.label)
```
  
Model 3  
The third model is log PM~2.5~ regressed on both explanatory variables, Wind Speed and Wind Direction.
```{r 'model3'}
lm.pm_ws_wd <- lm(data=air.quality.clinton, log.pm2.5 ~ ws+wd.label - 1)
# Below is same model without setting the intercept to 0. For R2 and ANOVA
lm.pm_ws_wd.intercept <- lm(data=air.quality.clinton, log.pm2.5 ~ ws+wd.label)
```
  
Model 4  
The fourth model is log PM~2.5~ regressed on only the interaction terms of both explanatory variables, Wind Speed and Wind Direction.
```{r 'model4'}
lm.pm_wswd <- lm(data=air.quality.clinton, log.pm2.5 ~ ws:wd.label -1)
# Below is same model without setting the intercept to 0. For R2 and ANOVA
lm.pm_wswd.intercept <- lm(data=air.quality.clinton, log.pm2.5 ~ ws:wd.label)
```
  
Model 5  
The fifth model is log PM~2.5~ regressed on Wind Direction and the interaction terms of both explanatory variables, Wind Speed and Wind Direction.
```{r 'model5', tidy=TRUE}
lm.pm_wd_wswd <- lm(data=air.quality.clinton, log.pm2.5 ~ wd.label-1 + ws:wd.label)
# Below is same model without setting the intercept to 0. For R2 and ANOVA
lm.pm_wd_wswd.intercept <- lm(data=air.quality.clinton, log.pm2.5 ~ wd.label + ws:wd.label)
```
  
Model 6  
The sixth model is log PM~2.5~ regressed on both Wind Direction, Wind Speed and the interaction terms of both explanatory variables, Wind Speed and Wind Direction. This is the most complex model by far.
```{r 'model6'}
lm.pm_ws_wd_wswd <- lm(data=air.quality.clinton, log.pm2.5 ~ ws*wd.label-1)
# Below is same model without setting the intercept to 0. For R2 and ANOVA
lm.pm_ws_wd_wswd.intercept <- lm(data=air.quality.clinton, log.pm2.5 ~ ws*wd.label)
```


Coefficient of determination, R^2^ value of all 6 models
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(broom)
# R2 for model 6, repeat for other model
glance(lm.pm_ws_wd_wswd.intercept)$r.squared
```

Check coefficient of determination, R^2^ value for each fitted linear models using `glance()` from `broom` library and results tabulated as below:
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
kable(models.fitness.df, caption="Coefficient of determination for all models")
```

Table 4 shows that model 5 and model 6 both has the exactly the same R~2~ value even though model 6 has extra term. It seems like the extra term (Wind speed) doesn't explain any extra variability in the data.  

However, we are going to use F test via the `anova()` function to test whether including the Wind Speed (ws) term improve how much variation in log PM~2.5~ is explained when compared to the model without the Wind Speed (ws) term.  

Formulate a hypothesis test about models:  

H~0~ : There is no increase in variability explained by the more complex model 6, with extra term (wind speed)  

Significant value set as $\alpha$ = 0.05.  


```{r 'anova2', echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Model 1: log.pm2.5 ~ wd.label + ws:wd.label
# Model 2: log.pm2.5 ~ ws * wd.label
anova(lm.pm_wd_wswd.intercept, lm.pm_ws_wd_wswd.intercept)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
pander::pander(anova(lm.pm_wd_wswd.intercept, lm.pm_ws_wd_wswd.intercept))
```

**Interpretation of ANOVA for regression models**
From table 5, model 5 and model 6 both has 7873 residual degrees of freedom. The *p* value is not show on the `anova()` result probably due to very tiny differnt between both RSS (regression sum of squared). Therefore, we conclude that model 6 explains slightly more of the varibility (really tiny RSS) but not so much so that the Wind Speed term is necessary. In result, we are unable to reject the null hypothesis, Model 5 the simpler model is the better model choice.


### Estimate model parameters
<!-- Provide estimates together with confidence intervals and relevant hypothesis tests. Include Rcode used. -->
<!-- Note: Estimates, confidence intervals and hypothesis tests -->

Estimates of the parameters in this model and their 95% confidence intervals
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
tidy(lm.pm_wd_wswd, conf.int = T)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
kable(tidy(lm.pm_wd_wswd, conf.int = T), caption = "Confident intervals of estimated parameters of model 5.")
```

From the *p* value of table 7, except `wd.labelN:ws`, `wd.labelNE:ws`, `wd.labelE:ws`, `wd.labelW:ws`, `wd.labelNW:ws`, all the other estimated parameters has shown statistical significant on explaining varibility of the data. This 5 statistical insignificant estimated parameters also shown to have include `0` in their 95% confident intervals.  


### Assess model fit
<!-- Use a goodness-of-fit statistic or other suitable measure -->

Goodness of fit plot
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Graph shows how much do our modelled value look like our observed values.'}
goodnessplot
```
Figure 10 shown how much do our modelled values look like our observed log PM~2.5~ values. They are expected them to fall very close to a straight line if the modelled values is very good explaining variability of the observed data.

At the end of the line, there is wide spread of modelled value along the line. This incompactible suggested that there are still alot of variability haven't been explained by our explanatory variables.


### Model checking
<!-- Are modelling assumptions upheld or violated? (1 para) -->
<!-- IMPERATIVE: NO DUMPING OF OUTPUT! All figures and other outputs from software must be referenced in the text (summary and highlights). -->
<!-- Note: are the residuals normal and homogeneous? -->

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Check lm whether the residuals are normally distributed
df.fort.pm_wd_wswd <- fortify(lm.pm_wd_wswd)
head(df.fort.pm_wd_wswd)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(df.fort.pm_wd_wswd), caption="fortify of model 5")
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Histogram of the residuals with density on the y axis with assumption of normal distribution of the residuals '}
Resid.histogram
```
The residuals look approximately normally distributed, but look a little skewed and out of shape around the mean.  


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Homogeneity of errors of model 5'}
homoplot
```
The residuals doesn't look like they have a mean of zero and constant variance as we move from left to right along the fitted values axis. This suggested that maybe the residuals are not residuals are normally distributed and homogenous in their variance.  

It look like there’s many unexplained variation in the residuals. The shape of the plot looks alot like fan out as we move from left to right along the fitted value axis. Most of the residuals concentrate around 1 to 1.5 fitted value.


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Quantile-quantile (QQ) plot of the standardised residuals.'}
qqplot
```

QQ plot from figure 13 shows that these residuals are not really well Normally distributed due to the skewness from the histograms and the departure from the geom_abline() line sample = theoretical. The sample residuals are less positive than expected as they are way below the line. Perhaps there is some structure to the unexplained variation in the residuals.

## 5. \textcolor{blue}{Interpret}
<!-- ~1 pp -->
<!-- Criterion: Interpretation of analyses, linked to Aims and Methods. -->
<!-- 7: Thorough and insightful interpretation of Quantitative analyses, which is very strongly connected to the Aims and Methods. -->
### Model interpretation
<!-- Provide a plain English interpretation that gives a holistic (overall) view of the results (1-3 paragraphs). -->
<!-- Note: What do our results mean in terms of the question of interest? Use the results from the analysis section to back up your claims. -->

It's very clear that wind speed and wind direction has play a role in explaining log PM~2.5~ based on our fitted model. The estimated parameters are statistical significant under our significal value 0.05.  

However, the fitted model explain not very much of the variability of the data based on low R^2^ value and the model ND assumption is not hold very well when we look at the residuals. That is to say, this model while is the best fitted so far, but its not enough to make prediction or inferences on future PM~2.5~ value.

<!-- ### Link back  -->
<!-- to the Question: provide a plain English interpretation of the model and what it means, in terms of the original question (1-2 sentences). -->
<!-- Note: Are there any problems with our models? How would we fix them if we could? -->

From the result, it suggested that thare is other factors in the system for example temperature might play a role in further predict the PM~2.5~ concentration in the air.  

This study answer the original question of whether meteorological measurements such as wind speed and wind direction have on the quality of air, particularly concentrations of PM~2.5~. Further include other measurement might improve the overall explanation of variability.
